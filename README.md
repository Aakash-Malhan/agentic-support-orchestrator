This project builds an Agentic AI customer support system capable of understanding queries, retrieving policy-grounded context, reasoning over steps, and executing live support actions (refunds, returns, order status) with human-in-the-loop escalation.

Designed to simulate next-gen enterprise AI contact centers like Amazon / Google / Meta.

**Objective**

-Automate customer support workflows using multi-agent reasoning + retrieval-augmented generation to boost agent efficiency, response quality, and customer experience.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features

 RAG with FAISS 
 Policy-grounded answers (no hallucinations)
âœ… Mock real support tools:
â€“ Order status lookup
â€“ Refund processing
â€“ Return label generator
 Human-in-loop escalation via confidence gating
